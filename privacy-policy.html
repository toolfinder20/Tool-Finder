  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>TThank you for using Tool Finder. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. By using the Site you agree to the terms below.

1. Information we collect

We may collect and process the following types of information:

a. Information you give us.
Examples: contact form messages, emails, or other information you voluntarily submit (name, email address, feedback).

b. Automatically collected information.
When you visit the Site we automatically collect data such as your IP address, browser type and version, pages visited, referral URL, device type, operating system, timestamps, and other usage statistics.

c. Cookies and similar technologies.
We use cookies and local storage to improve the Site experience, remember preferences, and provide basic analytics.

d. Third-party data.
If you interact with embedded third-party features (e.g., analytics, social widgets), those providers may collect data about your activity as described in their own policies.

2. How we use your information

We use information to:

Provide, maintain, and improve the Site and its features.

Respond to inquiries, requests, or support messages.

Monitor and analyze usage, performance, and security.

Detect, prevent, and address technical issues or abuse.

Comply with legal obligations.

We do not sell your personal information.

3. Analytics and third-party services

We may use third-party services for analytics (for example Google Analytics or alternatives), hosting (GitHub Pages), and other infrastructure. These services may collect usage information. Their use is governed by their privacy policies — please review those providers’ policies if you want details about their data practices.

4. Cookies and tracking

You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies may limit certain Site functionality. Briefly:

Strictly necessary cookies: Required for basic Site operation.

5. Data retention

We retain personal information only as long as needed for the purposes described (for example, to respond to inquiries or to meet legal obligations). Aggregate or anonymized usage data may be retained longer for analytics.

6. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or storage system is completely secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.

The Site is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.

Accessing the personal information we hold about you.

Requesting correction or deletion of your personal information.

Opting out of certain processing (e.g., marketing).

9. International transfers

Data collected may be stored and processed in countries other than your own (for example where our service providers operate). By using the Site you consent to such transfers.

10. Links to other sites

The Site may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for their privacy practices. Please review their privacy policies before providing personal information.
